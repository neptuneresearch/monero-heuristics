# Multiple Ring Members From Same Transactions, Within Same Transaction Or Transaction Input  
Neptune 2021-10-26

## Questions
a) how often it's been the case that a transaction has exactly 2 ring members (regardless if those ring members belong to the same input or to different inputs) that come from the same transaction.  
b) how often it's been the case that a transaction has exactly 3 ring members (regardless if those ring members belong to the same input or to different inputs) that come from the same transaction.  
c) how often it's been the case that a transaction has 4 or more ring members (regardless if those ring members belong to the same input or to different inputs) that come from the same transaction.  
d) how often it's been the case that a case from above appears twice or more often in one transaction (i.e., that a transaction has 2 or more ring members that come from the same transaction and another 2 or more ring members that also come from the same transaction (but from a different one than from which the first mentioned 2 or more ring members come from))  
e) Have these numbers changed over time? (maybe after changes in the decoy selection algorithm happened).

Given: RingCT transactions only
